## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites Check

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- ✅ Completed Modules 1-4 (especially Module 4: Authentication & Authorization)
- ✅ .NET 8.0 SDK installed
- ✅ Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code
- ✅ Basic understanding of web security concepts
- ✅ SQL Server or LocalDB (for database security examples)

### Quick Start

1. **Navigate to the SourceCode directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SourceCode/01-SecurityHeaders
   ```

2. **Run the first security example**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Open browser and test security headers**:
   ```
   https://localhost:7001
   ```

## 🔐 Key Security Concepts

### 1. Defense in Depth
Implementing multiple layers of security controls throughout your application.

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
Never trust, always verify - applies to all users, devices, and network traffic.

### 3. Secure by Default
Applications should be secure out of the box, with security features enabled by default.

### 4. Principle of Least Privilege
Users and processes should have only the minimum access rights needed to perform their functions.

## ⚠️ Common Security Vulnerabilities

### OWASP Top 10 (2023)
1. **Broken Access Control**
2. **Cryptographic Failures**
3. **Injection**
4. **Insecure Design**
5. **Security Misconfiguration**
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
