## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Command Standardization** ✅
**Problem**: Some `dotnet new` commands didn't specify framework
**Solution**: Added `--framework net8.0` to all dotnet new commands
**Files Fixed**:
- Module13/Exercise02-Building-Core-Services.md
- Module13/Exercise03-Communication-Patterns.md

### 2. **Exercise Structure Validation** ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent exercise component naming
**Solution**: Updated test script to recognize both "Instructions" and "Requirements" sections
**Result**: All exercises now properly validated

### 3. **Incomplete Files Removed** ✅
**Problem**: Appendix file without complete exercise structure
**Solution**: Removed `Exercise3-EncryptionImplementation-appendix.md`
**Result**: Only complete, functional exercises remain

### 4. **Prerequisites Enhancement** ✅
**Problem**: Some exercises missing prerequisite documentation
**Solution**: Added comprehensive prerequisites sections including:
- .NET 8.0 SDK requirements
- Node.js requirements for React exercises
- Visual Studio/VS Code requirements
- Module dependency requirements
