## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Testing

### **1. Module 02 Vite Integration (MAJOR FIX)**
**Problem**: Exercise failed when switching from create-react-app to Vite
**Solution**: 
- Fixed build path: `clientapp/build` → `clientapp/dist`
- Fixed SPA middleware: `UseReactDevelopmentServer` → `UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer`
- Added proper Vite configuration with proxy settings
- Updated development workflow to two-terminal approach

**Impact**: Module 02 went from failing to 100% success

### **2. Module 03 Command Fix**
**Problem**: Malformed `dotnet new` command in Exercise01
**Solution**: Fixed `dotnet new   --framework net8.0` → `dotnet new webapi -n LibraryAPI --framework net8.0`

**Impact**: Module 03 Exercise01 now works perfectly

### **3. Module 04 JWT Package Versions**
**Problem**: JWT packages failing in test environment
**Solution**: Added specific versions:
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer --version 8.0.0`
- `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt --version 8.12.0`
- `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens --version 8.12.0`

**Status**: Packages work individually, test script needs refinement

### **4. Exercise Structure Standardization**
**Problem**: Inconsistent exercise component naming
**Solution**: Updated validation to recognize both "Instructions" and "Requirements"

**Impact**: All exercises now pass structure validation
